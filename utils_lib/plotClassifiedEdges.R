# This function is useful for understanding the results of NBS output.
# Given a classification of nodes into a subset of networks (e.g., DMN,
#                                                            % FPN, CON, etc), it counts the number of edges present in a network both
# within and between networks and optionally plots the output as a matrix.
#
# The results are counted only at the level of binary topology
#
# -------
# % INPUTS:
# % -------
# % adj       - binary N*N adjacency matrix, where N is number of nodes. This matrix
#           could be the output of an NBS analysis; i.e., the matrix stored
#           in nbs.NBS.con_mat{1}.
#
# ids       - N*1 vector of network ids. Each network should be represented
#           as a unique number. Each row is a different node.
#
# plotFig   - set to 1 if you want to plot out; 2 for outPC; 3 for outNorm;
#           0 otherwise. Default is 0.
#
# labels    - M*1 cell, where M is the number of different networks. Each
#             cell contains a string representing the
#            network name. This is used to label the axes of the plot.
#
# -------
# % OUTPUTS:
# % -------
# % out       - M*M adjacency matrix indicating the number of edges between
#           each network pair. Values along diagonal represent edges within
#           a network.
#           NOTE: sum(sum(triu(out))) = sum(sum(adj))/2; in other
#           words, the number of unique edges in adj equals the number of
#           edges in the upper triangle (including the diagonal) of out.
#
# outPC     - The out matrix normalized by the number of unqiue edge to
#           yield the proportion of edges for each category.
#
# outNorm   - this matrix is normalized separetly for each pair of regions
#           by the total number of edges between them. The values thus
#           represent the connection density of the subgraph of nodes
#           belonging to a given pair of modules. This normalization
#           accounts for differences in the size of modules, which can bias
#           the results of outPC.

# Updates:
# % Feb 2017 added outNorm as output; options to plot different output
# matrices
#
# May 2020 (Sidhant Chopra)
# 1) Converted function from matlab to r
#
#2)Fixed the normalisation factor for outNorm matrix. Previously, the normalisaion
# was taking into account total number of edges between AND within two nodes (i.e. nSubTot = length(inds_i) + length(inds_j) ;
# (nSubTot^2 - nSubTot)/2). For between network connections, the normFactor should probably be computed by multiplying the numbers of regions
# in each pair of networks: length(inds_i)*length(inds_j) and for within network connections using ((length(inds_i)^2)-length(inds_i))/2.
